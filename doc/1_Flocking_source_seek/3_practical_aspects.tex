%Assumption for theoretical analysis:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item A1: Agents are modeled as double integrators
%	\item A2: The scalar field is assumed to be convex and twice differentiable
%	\item A3: Measurements of $\psi(q_i)$, $\nabla \psi(q_i)$ and $\nabla^2\psi(q_i)$ by agent $i$
%\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The flocking loop is runs at 20Hz 
	\item $G_{\textnormal{vel}}$: closed loop velocity tracking loop runs at 100Hz
	\item Initial tests show that the velocity controller is fast enough $\implies$ approximate $G_{\textnormal{vel}}$ by single integrator dynamics.
\end{itemize}

%\begin{frame}{Towards Experiments: Convexity and differentiability of field}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item The actual fields in the scenarios of interest will most likely not be convex and perhaps not smooth enough
%    \item Non-differentiability: Fit a locally smooth approximation
%    \item Non-convexity: The result can then be seen as a local convergence result
%    \item Experimental tests include log-convex fields and fields with 2 minima to probe the applicability of the algorithm when the assumption is violated.
%\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Corrupt the field strength measurement by +/- 5 percent of the field strength. 
	\item Estimate gradient by collecting local data and solving a least squares problem
	\item Estimate the hessian by collecting data from neighbors and solving another least squares problem
	\item Heuristic: Use Steepest Descent until the estimated hessian is positive definite.
\end{itemize}
