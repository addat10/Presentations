\begin{frame}{Conclusions and ongoing work}
Conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed a distributed control algorithm to address the source-seeking probem
    \item Analyzed the convergence properties
    \item Presented experimental results
\end{itemize}
Ongoing Work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider general non-linear agent dynamics instead of approximating it as a single integrator\footnote{A.  Attallah,  A.  Datar,  and  H.  Werner,  â€œFlocking  of  linear  parametervarying agents: Source seeking application with underwater vehicles (To be presented at IFAC 2020).}
    \item Consider level-tracking scenarios
