\begin{frame}{Source seeking problem: Abstraction}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item A group of $N$ agents (e.g underwater robots) are deployed in the region of interest
	\item Each agent has the following properties:
	    \begin{itemize}
	        \item Absolute position measurement (e.g GPS)\footnote{This assumption can be removed as long there is relative displacement measurement}
	        \item Communication with agents within a fixed distance
	        \item Concentration measurement sensor
	        \item Computation capabilities 
	    \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Problem:} Design distributed control algorithms that cause the agents to flock towards the source (location with the highest concentration) in a cooperative manner.
\end{itemize}
