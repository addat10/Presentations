\begin{itemize}
	\item A group of $N$ agents randomly deployed
	\item A single agent is externally "informed" (or controlled) to a desired location over time
	\item Each agent knows its $ID$ its desired offset from a commonly agreed location
	\item The dynamics of the complete system can be divided into
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Information flow dynamics over the network
		\item Local physical agent dynamics
	\end{itemize}	
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Core idea and key question}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Vast literature on first order protocols (information flow dynamics)
		\item Real agents typically have higher order models
		\item \textbf{Core idea:} Wrap local tracking controller around simple information flow dynamics \footnote{CortÃ©s, J. and Egerstedt, M., 2017. Coordinated control of multi-robot systems: A survey. SICE Journal of Control, Measurement, and System Integration, 10(6), pp.495-503.}
		\item \textbf{Core question:} Can we derive theoretical bounds on the loss in performance that depend on the local tracking performance?
	\end{itemize}
